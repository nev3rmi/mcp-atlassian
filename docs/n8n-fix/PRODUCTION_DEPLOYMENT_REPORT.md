- Agent communication issues
- Performance degradation

**Monitor**:
```bash
# On production server (192.168.66.3)
tail -f /tmp/mcp-server.log | grep "CREATE_ISSUE\|UPDATE_ISSUE\|ERROR"
```

### First Week

**Track**:
- Number of issues created via n8n
- JSON string parse success rate
- User feedback from Tony/Lily interactions
- Any edge cases discovered

**Review**:
- Server logs weekly
- Agent performance metrics
- User satisfaction

---

## Rollback Plan

**If Critical Issues Occur**:

### Step 1: Revert Code
```bash
ssh uvoadmin@192.168.66.3
cd ~/mcp-atlassian
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/mcp_atlassian/servers/jira.py
```

### Step 2: Restart Server
```bash
pkill -f "mcp-atlassian.*9000"
cd ~/mcp-atlassian
source .venv/bin/activate
nohup mcp-atlassian --transport streamable-http --port 9000 -vv > /tmp/mcp-server.log 2>&1 &
```

### Step 3: Verify
```bash
curl http://192.168.66.3:9000/healthz
```

**Rollback Tested**: ❌ No (not needed - deployment successful)
**Rollback Risk**: Low (backward compatible)
