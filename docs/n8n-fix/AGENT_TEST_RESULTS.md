## Recommendations for Lily Testing

### In n8n, verify Lily:

1. **Can analyze** data and provide insights
2. **Can create subtasks** using JSON string format
3. **Cannot create** parent issues (Tasks, Bugs, Stories, Epics)
4. **Redirects appropriately** when asked for forbidden operations
5. **Maintains professional** analytical tone
6. **Provides metrics** in responses

### Expected Behavior Differences

**When asked "Create a task"**:
- **Tony**: ✅ Creates it immediately
- **Lily**: ❌ Declines, redirects to Tony, offers alternatives

**When asked "Analyze sprint health"**:
- **Tony**: ⭐⭐⭐ Basic summary
- **Lily**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Detailed analysis with metrics

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- [ ] Test Lily in n8n with test script
- [ ] Validate Lily's permission boundaries
